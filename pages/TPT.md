## 5.5

### notes
- free websites arent truly free, you pay with your information
- content on the internet can be licenced out to people
- patents give you the rights to content

### questions
1. When you create a GitHub repository it requests a license type. Review the license types in relationship to this Tech Talk and make some notes in GitHub pages
Creative commons is a lisence that allows free distribution of software
3. Make a license for your personal and Team project. Document license you picked and why.
We picked the MIT lisence because it has multiple advantages over cretive commons


## 5.6

### notes
- do not click on emails from unknown sources
- do not share SSN or tax records, basically any personal info
- use 2FA to be more secure and dont use weak passwords

### questions
1. Describe PII you have seen on project in CompSci Principles.
you can see a student's first and last name in their repository and github pages, but that is the extent of it.
2. What are your feelings about PII and your exposure?
Personal information should only be exposed to trusted people and sources
3. Describe good and bad passwords? What is another step that is used to assist in authentication.
bed passwords are either too common or too easy to bruteforce (ie. 12345678 or qwerty). two factor authentication can be used as a second layer of security on top of a password (ie. authenticator app or sms verification)
4. Try to describe Symmetric and Asymmetric encryption.
symmetric encryption uses one key for encryption, and asymmetric uses 2 keys for encryption, one public and one private.
5. Provide and example of encryption we used in deployment.
when we used certbot to add https certification, that was an example of encryption
6. Describe a phishing scheme you have learned about the hard way. Describe some other phishing techniques.
i am pretty good at not clicking on suspicious emails, but i have gotten a ton of spam emails. the most common scheme i have seen tries to get the user to give tech support control of their computer to try and get banking details

* using API's is an example of crowdsourcing
* forking GitHub code is also an example of crowdsourcing.

### questions

i could send out a survey asking about a certain part of my site, using the data to add useful info to the site.
2. What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your final project be better with crowdsourcing?
if a survey was sent out to english classes that voted for best books, we could get a better understanding of what kind of books to recommend to students.

* del norte helps students become empowered on the internet by providing resources such as chromebooks to help get more students connected to the internet.
3. Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?
* even though del norte provides chromebooks to students, not all kids have a stable internet connection at home, making things like checking grades and submitting digital assignments significantly harder.

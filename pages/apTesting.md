# Practice Test Corrections

## Test 1 

### Score: 43/50

- Q6: didnt know how to read hexidecimal, it is much like binary but instead of base 2 it is base 16
- Q7: had trouble converting binary, 1001010 should be 2^6+2^3+2^1=74, J
- Q9: i said that they could spend less time waiting, which is false because the new system goes through a long list of common questions with no way to skip it
- Q14: since binary is base 2, adding a binary digit would increase unique items by 2x, not 10x
- Q23: cookies can store more personal info like passwords, ip addresses cannot be used for much malice without more info
- Q24: the internet uses data with metadata on where the data should go
- Q39: 80 seconds because since tasks cant be split up and there are 2 processors, you can give one processor the 60 second and the other the 30 and 50,totaling to 80 seconds minimum

## Test 2 

### Score: 48/50

- Q1: tasks cannot be split down infinitley, there is a limit
- Q41: the database does not store the price of individual items, therefore only the count of items can be observed

## Test 3

### Score: 45/50

- Q7: The procedure does not return the value of n * n. For a procedure to return n * n, it could initialize result to 0 and then repeatedly add n to result a total of n times.
- Q19: This information can be determined by calculating the difference between the sum of the scores before the lowest score was dropped and the sum of the scores after the lowest score was dropped.
- Q23: The average number of daily messages sent per user appears to increase after the mobile app was released.
- Q34: This algorithm has linear efficiency, so it runs in a reasonable amount of time. Therefore, a heuristic is not appropriate.
- Q44: The Fourth procedure calculates a power of n(similar to the Square and Cube procedures), but it does not generalize this functionality to calculate any power of n.

## Test 5

### Score: 44/50

- Q10: For the example given, End minus start plus 1 evaluates to 16. The loop should iterate 4 times, not 16 times.
- Q16: While the two programs initialize i to different values, the same values are printed inside the loop because program A prints i and then increments it and program B increments i and then prints it.
- Q25: B was wrong because the code segment will iterate over myList from right to left, removing the sixth element (20), the third element (30), and the second element (30). This results in the list [30, 10, 20], which contains no duplicates, as intended. D was wrong because the code segment will iterate over myList from right to left, removing the all elements but the first. This results in the list [50], which contains no duplicates, as intended.
- Q27: This statement does not provide enough information to conclude that the problem is undecidable. If it could be shown that an algorithm can be constructed that is always capable of providing a correct yes-or-no answer for all other instances of this problem, then this problem would be decidable.
- Q36: The user’s browser makes a request for the file, and the file is broken into packets by the server for transmission. The user’s browser does not request each packet in order.
- Q48: Certificate authorities do not verify the safety of Web sites.

# Practice Test Corrections

## Test 1 

### Score: 43/50

- Q6: didnt know how to read hexidecimal, it is much like binary but instead of base 2 it is base 16
- Q7: had trouble converting binary, 1001010 should be 2^6+2^3+2^1=74, J
- Q9: i said that they could spend less time waiting, which is false because the new system goes through a long list of common questions with no way to skip it
- Q14: since binary is base 2, adding a binary digit would increase unique items by 2x, not 10x
- Q23: cookies can store more personal info like passwords, ip addresses cannot be used for much malice without more info
- Q24: the internet uses data with metadata on where the data should go
- Q39: 80 seconds because since tasks cant be split up and there are 2 processors, you can give one processor the 60 second and the other the 30 and 50,totaling to 80 seconds minimum

## Test 2 

### Score: 48/50

- Q1: tasks cannot be split down infinitley, there is a limit
- Q41: the database does not store the price of individual items, therefore only the count of items can be observed

## Test 3

### Score: 45/50

- Q7: The procedure does not return the value of n * n. For a procedure to return n * n, it could initialize result to 0 and then repeatedly add n to result a total of n times.
- Q19: This information can be determined by calculating the difference between the sum of the scores before the lowest score was dropped and the sum of the scores after the lowest score was dropped.
- Q23: The average number of daily messages sent per user appears to increase after the mobile app was released.
- Q34: This algorithm has linear efficiency, so it runs in a reasonable amount of time. Therefore, a heuristic is not appropriate.
- Q44: The Fourth procedure calculates a power of n(similar to the Square and Cube procedures), but it does not generalize this functionality to calculate any power of n.

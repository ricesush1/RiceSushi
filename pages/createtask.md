# Practice Test Corrections

## Test 1 43/50

- Q6: didnt know how to read hexidecimal, it is much like binary but instead of base 2 it is base 16
- Q7: had trouble converting binary, 1001010 should be 2^6+2^3+2^1=74, J
- Q9: i said that they could spend less time waiting, which is false because the new system goes through a long list of common questions with no way to skip it
- Q14: since binary is base 2, adding a binary digit would increase unique items by 2x, not 10x
- Q23: cookies can store more personal info like passwords, ip addresses cannot be used for much malice without more info
- Q24: the internet uses data with metadata on where the data should go
- Q39: 80 seconds because since tasks cant be split up and there are 2 processors, you can give one processor the 60 second and the other the 30 and 50,totaling to 80 seconds minimum

## Test 2 48/50

- Q1: tasks cannot be split down infinitley, there is a limit
- Q41: the database does not store the price of individual items, therefore only the count of items can be observed
